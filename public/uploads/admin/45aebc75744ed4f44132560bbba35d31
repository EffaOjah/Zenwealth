Bless me bless me

Bless me God indeed

Death has been defeated

He is our victory 

Bless me bless me

God not just for me

But so everyone around me

Can have everything they need

Let all these folks that's with me

God have everything they need

Favor favor let it fall on me 

'Til I'm the conversation

Of all my enemies

Favor favor God not just for me

But so everyone around me

Can have everything they need

Let all these folks that's with me

God have everything they need 

We got everything we need

Our God's got everything we need
